*******************************


The Go Progamming Language has been said by many people as one of the best and
most advanced of the computer programming languages of the 21st Century.

For those using Linux, there is a script named "setup-go-linux.sh" which will
download various Go programming language related documentation to your computer.
It will require Subversion (SVN), Git and Hg (Mercurial) to be installed.
