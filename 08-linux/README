****************************


Here is your chance to put your programming skills to the test, and see what
it is like to build a complete Linux OS completely from the ground up.

For those already using Linux, there is a script named "setup-linux-source.sh"
which will download various related documentation to your computer. It will
require Subversion (SVN), Git and Hg (Mercurial) to be installed.
